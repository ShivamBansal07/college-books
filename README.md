# College Books

Books recommended for college by SRM for semester 1. Downloaded from https://z-lib.org .
Most books are too big to view on github, so I recommend downloading the pdfs and viewing it on your own systems. Also allows for offline access which is nice.
For requesting more books added here, open an issue ☆☆☆
